- defun need to be shadowed for optimizing declarations.
- maybe defmethod too?

- the best way to incorporate with CL's type system?

- I think we should accept two types of pointers: integer and
  implementation dependent pointer object.

- complex single-float and complex double-float?

- auto free

- (typep sa '(static-array double-float (*)))
