* Purpose

CL-static-array is to extend CL implementations to make foreign arrays
looks native to lisp arrays. So for code that used standard CL
functions and array operations, should work without any changes.

The purpose for using foreign arrays are:

- can operate on memory mapped files directly
- able to define REAL and efficient displaced arrays
- safer when used in foreign code.

Things need to be worried about:

- auto memory management
- performance compared to ordinary arrays (should be as efficient)
- portability
